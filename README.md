# Toy Computer (Computer Simulator)
This is an exercise project of building a virtual computer. The purpose is learning about computer itself.
Because of its experimental nature, I do not recommend this project for commercial use.

Note that this is not implemented straight from logic gates. Sometimes I have decided to replace them with "non-hardware" implementations to see whether the idea works before implementing it the hard way.
